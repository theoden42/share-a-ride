# Overview 

## Use Cases of the app

1. Each User can post a ride that they want to take. For Example, they want to take a ride from Sadar to Institute 
and they want to have 3 other people as companions. 
They can post this ride detail anonymously. 

2. Someone can accept a request from a pool of already generated requests that they have.

4. Calling a ride will be the task of someone posting a ride
